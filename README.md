Arduino Pac-Man for TVout. WORK-IN-PROGRESS!

This is just a demo. If you wish to play with it, you can modify the Joystick.ino code for whatever type of input you have (buttons, analog, etc.). Then, you will be able to drive Pac-Man around the maze and see what it does so far.

The dots are not handled yet, and there is no collission detection with the ghosts, but the ghosts are following their SCATTER pattern (except for BLINKY, who is following his CHASE pattern trying to target Pac-Man).

More updates on www.subethasoftware.com when Allen have some time to work on it.

I adapted the sources for PAL TV set and Funduino Joystick Shield
